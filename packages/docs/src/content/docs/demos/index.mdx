We provide demos for some of the Amazon product categories to showcase the capabilities of Mention Ads.
While we provide only a handful of demos, Mention Ads is equally capable of detecting and linking any product mentions across many different blog post styles.

At this point in time, we only support affiliate links to Amazon.
