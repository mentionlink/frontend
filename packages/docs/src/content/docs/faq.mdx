description: A collection of frequently asked questions when it comes to using the Mentionlink script.
---

## Performance

<details>
<summary>Will adding the script slow down my website?</summary>
**No.**
The `defer` attribute guarantees that not only the script is not downloaded before the page finished loading, but also that it won't execute until the page is fully loaded.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How large is the script?</summary>
The script is very small, about 2KB; it's both minified and Brotli-compressed.
GZip compression is also offered for browsers that don't support Brotli, although Brotli provides best compression in most scenarios.
Through the [GitHub CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/mentionads/frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/script.yml), the script is uploaded to an R2 bucket.
Then, the script is served through the content delivery network (CDN) of Cloudflare, which is mapped to `cdn.mentionlink.com`.
</details>

## Security

<details>
<summary>Will adding the script put my website at risk?</summary>
**No.**
All affiliate links added by Mentionlink have `target="_blank"`, thus `window.opener` will return `null`.
This approach instructs the browser to naviate to the e-commerce store without granting the new browsing context access to your website through the `window.opener` property on the opened window.
Please read the [MDN documentation on `rel="noopener"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noopener) for more information; please note that `rel="noopener"` is the equivalent of not setting `target="_blank"` so that the link opens in the same tab.
Mentionlink prefers to open affiliate links in new tabs, thus setting `target="_blank"` will suffice.

## Search engine optimization (SEO)

<details>
<summary>Will adding the script impact my search engine optimization (SEO)?</summary>
**No.**
All affiliate links added by Mentionlink have `rel="nofollow"`, thus search engines will ignore these outgoing links.
</details>

## Cookies

<details>
<summary>Do I need to include Mentionlink in a cookie consent banner?</summary>
**No.**
Mentionlink does **not** send any cookies.  This can be confirmed by seeing that the `fetch` call in the script does not set `"credentials": "include"` in the payload.  Please read the [MDN documentation on Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for more information.

Furthemore, the HTTP preflight (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) CORS request does not reply with the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, thus the browser will not allow the endpoint to set any cookies for the root domain or subdomains of `mentionlink.com`.  This can be confirmed by using the DevTools in Chrome.  Please read the [MDN documentation on Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) for more information.
