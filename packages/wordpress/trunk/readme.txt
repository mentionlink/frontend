This plugin connects to an API to detect keywords in the body of your web pages and blog posts which represent product mentions. After the detection of said keywords, the plugin automatically hyperlinks them to Amazon using your Amazon Associates affiliate code.

The plugin sends the body of the web page or blog post every time the content is loaded.
