# Frequently Asked Questions

## Performance

<details>
<summary>Will adding the Mention Ads script slow down my website?</summary>
No.
The `defer` attribute guarantees that not only the script is not downloaded before the page finished loading, but also that it won't execute until the page is fully loaded.

## Cookies

<details>
<summary>Do I need to include Mention Ads in a cookie consent banner?</summary>
No.
Mention Ads does **not** send any cookies.  This can be confirmed by seeing that the `fetch` call in the script does not set `"credentials": "include"` in the payload.  Please read the [MDN documentation on Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for more information.

Furthemore, the HTTP preflight (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) CORS request does not reply with the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, thus the browser will not allow the endpoint to set any cookies for the root domain or subdomains of `mentionads.com`.  This can be confirmed by using the DevTools in Chrome.  Please read the [MDN documentation on Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) for more information.
