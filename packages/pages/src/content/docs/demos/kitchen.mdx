## Mixed Green Salad Recipe

For a refreshing and healthy mixed green salad, start by gathering fresh ingredients: a mix of baby spinach, arugula, and romaine lettuce. Add thinly sliced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, and a handful of sliced radishes for a vibrant crunch. Top it off with crumbled feta cheese and a sprinkle of roasted sunflower seeds for added texture and flavor. For the dressing, whisk together extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and a touch of honey.

To prepare this salad effortlessly, consider using the OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner to wash and dry your greens quickly. For slicing and chopping, the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Knife Set is a reliable choice. Finally, serve your salad in a stylish Corelle Salad Bowl to impress your guests.
