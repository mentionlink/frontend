<Aside type="tip" title="What is Mention Ads?">
Mention Ads is a simple JavaScript that scans your blog posts, detects product mentions you haven’t linked, and automatically turns them into Amazon affiliate links, thus helping you capture missed revenue with zero extra effort and no upfront costs.

<Aside type="note" title="Blog Post Demo">
Consider the following blog post example, where affiliate links for some mentioned products were unintentionally omitted from the content. Mention Ads runs as soon as the web page loads, detects missed product mentions, and turns them into Amazon affiliate links.

## Makeup Bag Example

A well-curated makeup bag is essential for achieving a flawless look on any occasion. Start with a reliable foundation like the Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation, known for its long-lasting coverage and wide range of shades. Pair it with the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer to effectively cover blemishes, dark circles, or redness. For a natural flush, include the Benefit Cosmetics Hoola Bronzer or the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush, both of which are versatile and easy to blend. Enhance your lashes with the Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara, a cult favorite for its volumizing and lengthening effects.

For eyeshadow, opt for the Urban Decay Naked2 Basics Palette, which offers neutral shades perfect for everyday wear. Add definition with the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, a smudge-proof option for precise lines. For lips, the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Lipstick is a universally flattering shade that works for both casual and formal settings. Don’t forget to include a set of quality tools like the Real Techniques Everyday Essentials Brush Set or a Beautyblender sponge for seamless application.

A compact mirror, such as the Fenty Beauty Portable Touch-Up Mirror, is a must-have for on-the-go touch-ups. Finally, lock your look in place with the Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray, ensuring your makeup stays fresh throughout the day. With these essentials, your makeup bag will be ready to tackle any beauty challenge with ease and style.
