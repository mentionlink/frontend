<Aside type="tip" title="What is Mention Ads?">
Mention Ads is a simple JavaScript that scans your blog posts, detects product mentions you havenâ€™t linked, and automatically turns them into Amazon affiliate links, thus helping you capture missed revenue with zero extra effort and no upfront costs.

<Aside type="note" title="Blog Post Demo">
Consider the following blog post example, where affiliate links for some mentioned products were unintentionally omitted from the content. Mention Ads runs as soon as the web page loads, detects missed product mentions, and turns them into Amazon affiliate links.

The Garmin fenix 7 is a top-tier multisport GPS watch tailored for endurance athletes who demand precision, durability, and advanced training tools. Its long battery life, lasting up to 57 hours in GPS mode, ensures it can keep up with ultra-distance events, far surpassing the Apple Watch Ultra 2's 36-hour battery life in similar conditions. The fenix 7 is built to endure harsh environments with its rugged design, scratch-resistant sapphire lens, and water resistance up to 100 meters, making it ideal for extreme sports. It offers advanced performance metrics, such as VO2 max, recovery time, and training load, which are critical for athletes aiming to optimize their performance. Additionally, its multi-band GPS provides superior accuracy in challenging terrains, a feature that endurance athletes often rely on during trail runs or mountain expeditions. While the Apple Watch Ultra 2 boasts a sleek design and a vibrant display, it leans more towards lifestyle features and lacks the depth of training analytics provided by the fenix 7. For athletes who prioritize performance and reliability over smartwatch conveniences, the Garmin fenix 7 stands out as the ultimate choice, offering unparalleled tools to help them push their limits and achieve their goals.
