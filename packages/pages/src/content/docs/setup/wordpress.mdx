# WordPress installation instructions

1. Navigate to your WordPress admin dashboard. The dashboard can usually be found at `https://example.com/wp-admin/` where `example.com` must be replaced with your own domain.
2. In the _left_ sidebar, hover over **Appearance** and click on **Theme File Editor**.
3. In the _right_ sidebar, click on **Theme Header (header.php)**.

Then, add the following line inside the `<head>` tag, just before the `</head>` tag closes.

:::note
You must replace `example.com` in the `data-domain` attribute with your own custom domain name.
Do not prefix your domain with `www.` even if your website is configured to run on `www.example.com`.
:::

```diff lang="php"
<head>
  <?php wp_head(); ?>
+  <script data-domain="example.com" src="https://cdn.mentionads.com/v1/script.min.js" defer></script>
</head>
```
