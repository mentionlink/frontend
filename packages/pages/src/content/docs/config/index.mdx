## How to make the script ignore parts of the page

If you don't want the script to run on certain elements and its descendants, then please decorate any such HTML element with the `data-mentionads-ignore` attribute.  For example:

```html {1}
<div data-mentionads-ignore>
  <p>Text you don't want Mention Ads to hyperlink or rewrite.</p>
</div>
```
